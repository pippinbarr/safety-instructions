## Description

*Mavis Beacon Teaches Horrible Death In An Air Wreck! See if your fingers are fast enough to save yourself from the many grisly deaths available in the world of air travel. And learn something in the process! Like typing! And how to not die!*

*Safety Instructions* was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. It uses sound effects I made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and a soundtrack made with [WolframTones](http://tones.wolfram.com/). The font in Safety Instructions is [Silkscreen](http://www.allfreefonts.com/font-8878-silkscreen.html) by [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/). The game is now being presented in emulation thanks to [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs).
