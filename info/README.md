# Safety Instructions

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
Safety Instructions was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe&#8217;s FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. It uses sound effects I made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and a soundtrack made with [WolframTones](http://tones.wolfram.com/). The font in Safety Instructions is [Silkscreen](http://www.allfreefonts.com/font-8878-silkscreen.html) by [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/).
