>>> SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS <<<
        A game of saving your life.


The basic concept: minisituations from an air safety card that you have to negotiate by typing the appropriate word (or phrase) in before a timer elapses (and you die).

It then consists almost entirely of a sequence of animations (the positive and negative outcomes) and mechanics for checking what people typed.

You could easily change difficulty levels by varying what they have to type.
e.g. "BRACE" versus "BRACE BRACE"? Haha.

(Levels: Easy, Hard, Fatalistic Acceptance of Early Death)



PER MINIGAME / SCENE
- A particular word(s) you have to type to activate the success animation.
- A success animation in which you survive.
- A failure animation in which you die (unless it's a bonus?)
- A BG animation that keeps the intro and typing periods visually engaging rather than flat - e.g. movement suggestive of plane (juddering), water movement, life raft bobbing. Also potential for the visual thing to be progress toward failure - e.g. life raft sinking... any other things suggestive of impending doom... almost like you could register the time limit this way somehow - fire bursting out of windows in turn until they get to you at the door.
- At least hypothetically, the success/failure should more or less lay over the top of the BG animation if at all possible. BG animation should be very very simple and possibly looping and rhythmic unless I go the progress route.

Maybe at the end of each animation it should say "SURVIVAL!" or "DEAD!" with some kind of sound effect.

= BUCKLE =

Buckle your seatbelt because the plane is crashing!

FRONT VIEW
BG: Maybe just clouds passing out the window, things should be calm here.
(Progress: increasing turbulence?)
SUCCEED: Big turbulence but you stay in your seat

Putting a mask on a baby.

FRONT VIEW
BG: baby crying and waving arms
(Progress: baby turns bluer and bluer)
SUCCEED: Put mask on baby
FAIL: Baby goes blackblue and dies


= BRACE =

Bracing for impact (with the water). Should be wearing the breathing mask in this instance?

(Progress: increasing tilt?)
SUCCEED: Brace position, survive the crash
FAIL: Smack head against seat and die

= SLIDE =

Sliding down the slide to safety.

SIDE VIEW / WIDE VIEW
BG: Wider shot of the plane, bobbing in water? Sinking?
(PROGRESS: Flames coming through windows closer and closer?)
(ANIM TYPING: Preparatory knee bends or something?)
SUCCESS: Slide down the slide
FAIL: You burn up from flames inside - flames burst out the door and incinerate you


= DODGE =

Dodge a shark coming up at you from beneath
(If you hadn't inflated the vest this could be where you drown...)

FRONT VIEW
BG: Top half above water, bottom half under
PROGRESS: Shark coming up toward your legs

Get into the one of the floatation devices

SIDE VIEW?
BG: Bobbing of life raft
PROGRESS: More violent bobbing?
SUCCESS: Get in
FAIL: Drown


= PUSH =

Shoving someone out of the sinking life boat, or hitting someone off the edge. Leonardo Di Caprio? Fat guy?

SUCCESS: raft bobs back up with less weight
FAIL: The boat sinks


= FIGHT =

Killing someone in the boat for food. (or over food)

SIDE VIEW, ZOOMED
BG: Sky?

ANIM TYPING: your fork getting closer
SUCCESS: You stab them
FAIL: They stab you.


= SOME REALLY LONG PHRASE THEY HAVE NO HOPE OF TYPING =

The last one which they won't be able to get in which case they die, the last person on the floatation device, floating away... maybe a helicopter is going past, or a ship, and you have to type "signal ship with makeshift blah blah blah"... 

WIDE VIEW
BG: ?
PROGRESS: ?
SUCCESS: You survive...
FAIL: The game ends on you dying - the ship moves on


END: At least you didn't eat anyone... at least you've still got your heels on... at least you have your bag... at least that baby's still alive...
