>> SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS <<




= THE CODE STRUCTURE =

* One big question is whether each of the sequences should be a separate PlayState?
	* This would help in terms of transitions?
* Or whether it should all be in PlayState and it just tracks what the current StageIs and loads things appropriately...
* Any given Stage needs
	* The FlxSprite that has the animations (FlxSprite)
	* The defined frames of the three animations (int Array?)
	* The text needed to be types for that Stage (FlxText)
* So a Stage is a FlxGroup, easy enough.
* And the PlayState has an Array (?) of Stages that it runs through? (What about when there are bonus levels?) and an Index pointing to the CurrentStage
* Maybe the Array contained all the Stages, but null if the Stage hasn't been unlocked? Then you just check for null to avoid, and if it's unlocked you make the Stage object.

* Stage(FlxSprite, Frames, Frames, Frames, Text)
* Stage.getText()
* Stage.playDefault()
* Stage.playFail()
* Stage.playSuccess()

* And in the PlayState loop you just create the GameStage array
* Then in update you do the appropriate actions on the current state - which means that you check for keyboard and then play the appropriate animation, and then change to the next stage if they succeeded.


= THE ANIMATION GUIDELINES =

* 50x50 pixels is a basic guideline for a square containing some action (e.g. the brace position).
* Looking at the Air France one, it seems like I could go constant height, but some double width 100x50 panels (e.g. for slide)
* Probably makes sense to have a rounded-corner frame around them all, but outside the 50x50 area? Or on its periphery?
* For each sequence it makes sense to have both the success and fail animations in the same image sequence so that either one can be triggered from the same FlxSprite in the code.
* There remains the question of some kind of default animation loop prior to the result loop - there's the shake() method for pre-brace and probably for buckle, but generally will need something else the rest of the time... basically: some kind of "start loop" followed by the succeess and fail actions, which should map to the start loops first frame so that it's easy to make the transition.

* Other than these guidelines, I basically just need to draw them?


= OTHER GRAPHICS =

* Could draw graphics for text or use built-in. It should say "SAFE!" or "DEAD!" depending on how you do in each STAGE, they should be called STAGES.
